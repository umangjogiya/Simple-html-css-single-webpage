                <h2>|| let's go for GYM ||</h2>
                <p>A gym, short for gymnasiums is an indoor venue for exercise and sports. The word is derived from the ancient 
                Greek term "gymnasiums".They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.
                "Gym" is also the commonly used name for a "fitness centre" or health club, which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or 
                describe adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, 
                tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries,
                Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university, with or
                without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.</p>

            <p>Gymnasiums also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals.
            In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings 
            specifically designed for them. Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more 
            as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword
             fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing, as well as schools 
             of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.</p>
